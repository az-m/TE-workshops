          Remarkable scenes here today in Village Town where we have been
          informed that a local cat (name of Basil) has been found ... on Mars*!
        </p>
        <p>
          Basil, much beloved pet of Miss Helen Turner of Stokes Street, had
          been thought missing for the last week, leaving Miss Turner in great
          distress. But the owner's loss turned to amazement and pride at the
          unbelievable discovery that her pet had been on Mars all along.
